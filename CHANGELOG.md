* ### Major Changes

    * Added support for communicating with DAQmx devices through gRPC using [NI gRPC Device Server](https://github.com/ni/grpc-device). This enables using DAQmx with the MeasurementLink session management service.
        * The initialization methods for `Task`, `Scale`, and other classes now accept a keyword-only `grpc_options` parameter. Pass a `GrpcSessionsOptions` object to enable gRPC support.
        * The `System` class now has a `remote()` method which accepts a `GrpcSessionOptions` object.
        * [NI gRPC Device Server](https://github.com/ni/grpc-device) version 2.2 or later is required. Older versions of NI gRPC Device Server are unsupported because they are missing bug fixes needed to support nidaqmx-python.
    * The following functions now emit `DeprecationWarning` when called:
        * `nidaqmx.errors` module: `check_for_error`, `is_string_buffer_too_small`, and `is_array_buffer_too_small` are `ctypes`-specific helper functions, so they have been moved to an internal module.
        * `System` class: `set_analog_power_up_states` does not support `PowerUpStates.TRISTATE` and `get_analog_power_up_states` has design issues that make the previous implementation unworkable, so they have been deprecated in favor of `set_analog_power_up_states_with_output_type` and `get_analog_power_up_states_with_output_type`.
    * The internals of the `nidaqmx` package have been refactored to support gRPC:
        * Access to the DAQmx driver is now handled by the internal `BaseInterpreter` abstract base class. There are separate implementations of this abstract base class for `ctypes` vs. gRPC.
        * Internal initialization methods now accept an `interpreter` parameter. Methods that take an `interpreter` are not part of the public API.
        * Added a stub generator which will generate the gRPC stub files based on the proto files present in `src/codegen/protos`. The files will be generated into `generator/nidaqmx/_stubs`.
        * The internal `nidaqmx._task_modules.read_functions` and `nidaqmx._task_modules.write_functions` modules have been removed. If your application uses these modules, you must update it to use public APIs such as `task.read()`/`task.write()`, `task.in_stream.read()`/`task.out_stream.write()`, or `nidaqmx.stream_readers`/`nidaqmx.stream_writers`.
        * Updated the existing tests to run with and without gRPC support.
        * Added multiple test cases to improve the overall test coverage.

* ### Known Issues
   * Comparisons between DAQmx object instances do not take gRPC remoting into account. For example, `Device("Dev1")` refers to a local device and `Device("Dev1", grpc_options=...)` refers to a remote device, but they are considered equal. Likewise, two instances of `Device("Dev1", grpc_options=...)` with different remote hosts are considered equal. 

## 0.7.0

* ### Merged Pull Requests
    * [217: Handle leading zeros in flatten/unflatten implementation](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/issues/217)

    * [256: nidaqmx: Remove Python 2.7 workarounds](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/pull/256)
* ### Resolved Issues
    * [216: Can read channel_names of PersistedTask but not channels](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/issues/216)
* ### Major Changes
    * Added a generator that produces the `nidaqmx` module code.
    * Some properties were renamed in an effort to improve the consistency of the `nidaqmx` module and to support maintainability of the generator. The previous names are still usable, but will emit a `DeprecationWarning` on usage. These deprecated properties may be removed in a future update.
    * Unused enums have been removed. This affects enums that are solely used by DAQmx features that are not supported in the `nidaqmx` module, such as external calibration, the DAQmx switch API, and internal APIs.
    * Refactored the repository folder structure as follows:
        * `generated/nidaqmx/` - The output of the code generator and source for the build `nidaqmx` module. Do not directly modify any files in this folder.
        * `examples/` - Example programs demonstrating how to use the `nidaqmx` module.
        * `src/codegen/` - The code generator.
        * `src/handwritten/` - Hand-maintained files that are copied as-is during code generation.
        * `tests` - Test code that exercises the `nidaqmx` module to ensure it functions correctly and doesn't introduce regressions.
    * Multiple various test improvements in support of the generator refactoring.
