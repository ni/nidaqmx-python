    * [256: nidaqmx: Remove Python 2.7 workarounds](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/pull/256)
* ### Resolved Issues
    * [216: Can read channel_names of PersistedTask but not channels](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/issues/216)
* ### Major Changes
    * Added a generator that produces the `nidaqmx` module code.
    * Some properties were renamed in an effort to improve the consistency of the `nidaqmx` module and to support maintainability of the generator. The previous names are still usable, but will emit a `DeprecationWarning` on usage. These deprecated properties may be removed in a future update.
    * Unused enums have been removed. This affects enums that are solely used by DAQmx features that are not supported in the `nidaqmx` module, such as external calibration, the DAQmx switch API, and internal APIs.
    * Refactored the repository folder structure as follows:
        * `generated/nidaqmx/` - The output of the code generator and source for the build `nidaqmx` module. Do not directly modify any files in this folder.
        * `examples/` - Example programs demonstrating how to use the `nidaqmx` module.
        * `src/codegen/` - The code generator.
        * `src/handwritten/` - Hand-maintained files that are copied as-is during code generation.
        * `tests` - Test code that exercises the `nidaqmx` module to ensure it functions correctly and doesn't introduce regressions.
    * Multiple various test improvements in support of the generator refactoring.

## 0.6.0

* ### Resolved Issues
    * [132: __future__ imports are now all mandatory in the minimum supported python version](https://github.com/ni/nidaqmx-python/issues/132)
