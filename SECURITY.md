# Security

NI views the security of our software products as an important part of our commitment to our users.  This includes source code repositories managed through the [NI](https://github.com/ni) GitHub organization.

## Reporting Security Issues

We encourage you to report security vulnerabilities to us privately so we can follow the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD).  This allows us time to thoroughly investigate security issues and publicly disclose them when appropriate.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by sending an email to [security@ni.com](mailto:security@ni.com) with sufficient details about the type of issue, the impact of the issue, and how to reproduce the issue.  You may use the [NI PGP key](https://www.ni.com/en/support/security/pgp.html) to encrypt any sensitive communications you send to us. When you notify us of a potential security issue, our remediation process includes acknowledging receipt and coordinating any necessary response activities with you.
