            reallocation_policy (Optional[ReallocationPolicy]): Specifies
                the reallocation policy to use when the read yields more
                samples than the current capacity of the waveform.
            timeout (Optional[float]): Specifies the amount of time in
                seconds to wait for samples to become available. If the
                time elapses, the method returns an error and any
                samples read before the timeout elapsed. The default
                timeout is 10 seconds. If you set timeout to
                nidaqmx.constants.WAIT_INFINITELY, the method waits
                indefinitely. If you set timeout to 0, the method tries
                once to read the requested samples and returns an error
                if it is unable to.

        Returns:
            int:

            Indicates the number of samples acquired by each channel.
            NI-DAQmx returns a single value because this value is the
            same for all channels.
