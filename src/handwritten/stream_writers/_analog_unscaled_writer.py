        Writes one or more unscaled 16-bit integer samples to one or
        more analog output channels in a task.

        If the task uses on-demand timing, this method returns only
        after the device generates all samples. On-demand is the default
        timing type if you do not use the timing property on the task to
        configure a sample timing type. If the task uses any timing type
        other than on-demand, this method returns immediately and does
        not wait for the device to generate all samples. Your
        application must determine if the task is done to ensure that
        the device generated all samples.

        Args:
            data (numpy.ndarray): Contains a 2D NumPy array of unscaled
                16-bit integer samples to write to the task.

                Each row corresponds to a channel in the task. Each
                column corresponds to a sample to write to each channel.
            timeout (Optional[float]): Specifies the amount of time in
                seconds to wait for the method to write all samples.
                NI-DAQmx performs a timeout check only if the method
                must wait before it writes data. This method returns an
                error if the time elapses. The default timeout is 10
                seconds. If you set timeout to
                nidaqmx.constants.WAIT_INFINITELY, the method waits
                indefinitely. If you set timeout to 0, the method tries
                once to write the submitted samples. If the method could
                not write all the submitted samples, it returns an error
                and the number of samples successfully written.
