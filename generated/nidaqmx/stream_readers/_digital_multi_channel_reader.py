        This read method accepts a preallocated NumPy array to hold the

        interoperability with NumPy and SciPy.

        Passing in a preallocated array is valuable in continuous
        acquisition scenarios, where the same array can be used
        repeatedly in each call to the method.

        Args:
            data (numpy.ndarray): Specifies a preallocated 2D NumPy
                array of 8-bit unsigned integer values to hold the
                samples requested. The size of the array must be large
                enough to hold all requested samples from all channels
                in the task; otherwise, an error is thrown.

                Each row corresponds to a channel in the task. Each
                column corresponds to a sample from each channel. The
                order of the channels in the array corresponds to the
                order in which you add the channels to the task or to
                the order of the channels you specify with the
                "channels_to_read" property.

                If the size of the array is too large or the array is
                shaped incorrectly, the previous statement may not hold
                true as the samples read may not be separated into rows

                property on this channel reader object to True to

                the performance of the method.
            number_of_samples_per_channel (Optional[int]): Specifies the

                If you set this input to nidaqmx.constants.
                READ_ALL_AVAILABLE, NI-DAQmx determines how many samples

                method reads all the samples currently available in the
                buffer.

                If the task acquires a finite number of samples and you
                set this input to nidaqmx.constants.READ_ALL_AVAILABLE,
                the method waits for the task to acquire all requested
                samples, then reads those samples. If you set the
                "read_all_avail_samp" property to True, the method reads
                the samples currently available in the buffer and does
                not wait for the task to acquire all requested samples.
            timeout (Optional[float]): Specifies the amount of time in
                seconds to wait for samples to become available. If the
                time elapses, the method returns an error and any
                samples read before the timeout elapsed. The default
                timeout is 10 seconds. If you set timeout to
                nidaqmx.constants.WAIT_INFINITELY, the method waits
                indefinitely. If you set timeout to 0, the method tries
                once to read the requested samples and returns an error
                if it is unable to.
